Title: Resolve the spatial locations of single cells
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Chunxuan Shao
Maintainer: Chunxuan Shao <c.shao@dkfz-heidelberg.de>
Description: Identify the spatial locations of single cells based on expression profiles (e.g., scRNA-seq) via Elastic Net with adaptive weights. 
    Gene expressions in signle cells are used response variable, while expression in reference bins are used as predictor variables. Regulated regression
    by Elastic Net is employed to find optimal and sparse solutions. The adaptive weights could be calculated via canonical correlation analysis, or ridge regression.
